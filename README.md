# MPC Cart-Pendulum 

Performs model predictive control on the cart-pendulum system from Steve Brunton's control bootcamp

The file mpc_cartpend.m contains the model predictive control algorithm and options for adding different types of constraints, both state constraints and actuator constraints. It also contains a comparison vs LQR, due to the similarities between LQR and MPC, and how specific choice of the terminal cost in MPC results in control that is identical to LQR (if constraints are inactive).
